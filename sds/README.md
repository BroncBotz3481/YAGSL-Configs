# Swerve Drive Specialties
The folders in this repository represent current working configurations of teams using Swerve Drive Specialties modules, under these get more specific since teams use different absolute encoders, motors, and gyroscopes.  
The subfolders are isolated based off motors since that is the biggest factor in configuration differences.
